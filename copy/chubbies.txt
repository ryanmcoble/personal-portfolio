Excerpt:
"Built a custom Shopify app and API for Chubbies Shorts that integrated with their Shopify store, allowing customers to vote on male models and for men to submit portfolios for a modeling contest. Worked on a highly customized Shopify theme for Chubbies store."

As a Shopify developer at Rocket Code, I was responsible for developing a custom Shopify app and API for Chubbies Shorts.
The app enabled men to participate in a modeling contest, where they could submit a portfolio that included a tagline, description, details, a picture and a video.
Customers of Chubbies Shorts were also able to vote on the male models through the app, which was integrated with Chubbies' Shopify store.
I also worked on a highly customized Shopify theme for Chubbies store, ensuring a seamless and unique user experience for their customers.
This project involved working closely with the Chubbies team to understand their specific needs and implementing a solution that met their goals.
The result was a dynamic, user-friendly platform that effectively showcased the male models and engaged customers in the contest.
